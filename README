What's FST-01?
==============

Flying Stone Tiny 01 (FST-01) is a USB 32-bit computer by STM32
processor.  It has minimalist design.  MCU running at 72MHz, SPI flash
memory, SWD port for main flash ROM update, and two I/O pins.
That's all.

This is designed mainly for our own projects: Gnuk, NeuG, and Gone.

FST-01G is another revision, because KiCAD has been changed and I changed
LDO regulator.



These files are for what?
=========================

This is FST-01 PCB design for KiCAD.

I am using kicad of 4.0.2+dfsg1-4 in Debian.

Terms and conditions
====================

FST-01 is my work, but I am not sure how and what I can demand for
users.  I think that PCB design and files can be copyrighted.

I assume that users don't use verbatim copy of this design.  It
includes my trade marks of "FST-01G" and Flying Stone logo.  Please
just don't include silk bottom layer, if you build your own PCB.

I would like to ask users to keep the design as "Open Hardware".  See
the page for the definition of "Open Hardware":

    http://www.opencollector.org/Whyfree/open_hardware.html

That is, interface, design itself, and tools for the design should be
free.  Tools should be Free Software, in my opinion.  It is not enough
if tools are available by download with no cost.  Source code of tools
should be available and modification can be permitted.

Nevertheless, schematic design is distributed under Creative Commons
Attribution 3.0 Unported License (CC BY 3.0).  See:

    http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/

Schematic design can be used for any purpose and you don't need to
open your modifications to my design.

External modules
================

For module/SMT_CAP.mod and module/SMT_RES.mod, module drawings are
copied from w_smd_cap.mod and w_smd_resistors.mod by W.Lain.  Files
