What's FST-01?
==============

Flying Stone Tiny 01 (FST-01) is a USB 32-bit computer by STM32 or
GD32 processor.  It has minimalist design.  It is composed by MCU
running at 72MHz or 108MHz, LED to notify a user, a hall effect sensor
for user input, and SWD port for main flash ROM update.  That's all.

This is designed mainly for our own projects: Gnuk and NeuG.

FST-01SZ is the third revision, integrating feedback from users.

MCU is new one from China.  Instead of offering extension I/O,
fixed-purpose sensor is added.  Optional flash memory is removed.

Please note that the format of KiCAD has been changed (again).



These files are for what?
=========================

This is FST-01 PCB design for KiCAD.

I am using kicad of 5.0.1+dfsg1-3 in Debian.

Terms and conditions
====================

FST-01 is my work, but I am not sure how and what I can demand for
users.  I think that PCB design and files can be copyrighted.

I assume that users don't use verbatim copy of this design.  It
includes my trade marks of "FST-01SZ" and Flying Stone logo.  Please
just don't include silk bottom layer, if you build your own PCB.

I would like to ask users to keep the design as "Open Hardware".  See
the archived page for the definition of "Open Hardware":

    https://web.archive.org/web/20140407171518/http://www.opencollector.org/Whyfree/open_hardware.html

That is, interface, design itself, and tools for the design should be
free.  Tools should be Free Software, in my opinion.  It is not enough
if tools are available by download with no cost.  Source code of tools
should be available and modification can be permitted.

Nevertheless, schematic design is distributed under the Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).  See:

Schematic design can be used for any purpose and you don't need to
publish your modifications over my design.

External modules
================

The modules of module.pretty/c_0402.kicad_mod and
module.pretty/c_0603.kicad_mod was the one in the original file name
of module/SMT_CAP.mod in the version 1.00 of FST-01.

The module of module.pretty/r_0402.kicad_mod was module/SMT_RES.mod
in the version 1.00 of FST-01.

Those module drawings are copied from w_smd_cap.mod and
w_smd_resistors.mod by W.Lain.  Files were downloaded from:
